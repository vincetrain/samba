Docker container of [Samba](https://www.samba.org/), an implementation of the Windows SMB networking protocol.
Original container forked from [dockur/samba](https://github.com/dockur/samba).

This fork is configured to focus more on implementing a multi-user share using Samba homes shares.

## Usage  üê≥

Via Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  samba:
    image: dockurr/samba
    container_name: samba
    ports:
      - 445:445
    volumes:
      - /home/example/data:/storage
```

Via Docker CLI:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 445:445 -v "/home/example/data:/storage" vincetrain/samba
```

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

### How do I connect to a user's home share?

You can connect to a user's share by using the following address: [server-address]/[user name]

On Windows Explorer, this looks like `\\192.168.2.2\samba`, where "192.168.2.2" is replaced with the address of the server behind this container, and "samba" is replaced by the username".

By default this container is configured to host a share for user "samba" with password "secret".  

### How do I modify the default credentials or add more users?

You can change the default credentials or add more users inside the provided [users.conf](https://github.com/vincetrain/samba/blob/master/users.conf) file, and binding the file into the container as follows:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /example/users.conf:/etc/samba/users.conf
```
### How do I modify other settings?

If you need more advanced features, you can completely override the default configuration by modifying the [smb.conf](https://github.com/vincetrain/samba/blob/master/smb.conf) file in this repo, and binding your custom config to the container like this:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /example/smb.conf:/etc/samba/smb.conf
```
## Building  üî®
Build with buildkit!

Run:
`DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . -t [registry:tag]` inside of this repository's directory.

Or have the following configuration in your `daemon.json`
```json
{
    "features": {
        "buildkit": true
    }
}
```
And build normally.
